          I am a Junior Front-End Developer transitioning from a background in accounting and economics. I enjoy building responsive, clean, and user-friendly web applications using React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. My previous experience gave me strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities.
